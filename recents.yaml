# Simply an array of names of SciolyFF files that were recently added, most
# recent files first, for purpose of displaying them on the results index page.
#
# This is done manually here because (A) it's easier to program and (B) there's
# no good way of distinguishing between a file that was recently added and a
# file that was recently modified -- to correct a typo, for example.
